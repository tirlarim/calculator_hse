Develop a calculator

The calculator should be able to parse expressions like:
exp(-j*PI*alpha*len/v0)
alpha = sqrt(PI*len/(s1+s2))
s1 = cos(real(S11)*real(S22))
s2 = (sin(S11*S22))^2
len = 191.76
v0 = 299.799
S11 = -0.01-0.92j
S22 = 0.0001+0.997j
expression with brackets, 6 arithmetic operations, there are variables and functions in the expression, the value of variables can be set as another expression
the value of variables can be a complex number, the library of complex numbers can be used
there can be constants in the expression
PI
e
j - imaginary unit
There can be functions in the expression
cos
sin
tg
log
ln
sqrt
pow
abs
exp
real
imag
mag
phase
